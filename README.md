# -Real-time-Object-Detection-using-TensorFlow-and-OpenCV
This repository contains a Python script for real-time object detection using TensorFlow and OpenCV. The script utilizes a pre-trained deep learning model to detect objects in a webcam feed, providing a visual representation of the detected objects along with their corresponding class labels and confidence scores.
Features:
Integration of a pre-trained object detection model
Real-time processing of webcam feed
Visualization of detected objects with bounding boxes and class labels
Requirements:
TensorFlow
OpenCV
NumPy
Usage:
Clone the repository.
Replace the model_path variable with the actual path to your pre-trained model.
Run the script.
Feel free to customize and extend the code to suit your specific use case. Contributions are welcome!

Note: Ensure that you have the necessary dependencies installed before running the script. Refer to the requirements section for details.
