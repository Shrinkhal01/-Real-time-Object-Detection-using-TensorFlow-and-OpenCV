# -Real-time-Object-Detection-using-TensorFlow-and-OpenCV
This repository contains a Python script for real-time object detection using TensorFlow and OpenCV. The script utilizes a pre-trained deep learning model to detect objects in a webcam feed, providing a visual representation of the detected objects along with their corresponding class labels and confidence scores.
