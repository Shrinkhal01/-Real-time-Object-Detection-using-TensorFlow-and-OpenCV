# -Real-time-Object-Detection-using-TensorFlow-and-OpenCV
Description:

Python script for real-time object detection using TensorFlow and OpenCV
Utilizes a pre-trained deep learning model for object detection
Provides visual representation of detected objects, bounding boxes, class labels, and confidence scores in a webcam feed
#Note :
-The thing over here is that I kept the number 1 in the  cap variable's value 
-It is because I used the virtual camera on my laptop 
Features:

Integration of a pre-trained object detection model
Real-time processing of webcam feed
Visualization of detected objects with bounding boxes and class labels
Requirements:

TensorFlow
OpenCV
NumPy
Usage:

Clone the repository.
Replace the model_path variable with the actual path to your pre-trained model.
Change the value 1 to 0 in cap variable to make it point the default integrated webcam
